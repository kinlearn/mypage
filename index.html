            Hey there! üëã<br />
            I am KinLearns ü¶â (I love owls üòÖ). <br />
            I am a mechanical engineer tured UX designer who is now learning
            coding and aspiring to become a fullstack developer. I face a lot of
            problems and difficulties while learing to code. As we learn
            something, and become good at the skill, we kinda forget the
            struggle while learing in the beginning.. I am here to share my
            journey from the very beginning. I share my my insights here on this
            site, also on <a href="">Twitter</a>, <a href="">My blog</a>,
            <a href="">Instagram</a>. (No, I'm not one of those content creators
            ü§£)
